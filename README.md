Hi there, I'm Mark

I am a software engineer working at [Bamboo](https://bambooengineering.io/) in the fintech space.

I primarily work with the tech stack mentioned here: https://bambooengineering.io/our-technology-and-culture/ and aside from those technologies I try to keep an eye on emerging technoologies as they develop. Zig being an example of something I would like to delve into deeper and I look forward to seeing how it matures as a language.

## Projects

I don't have many projects to note but something I did look into recently is the extensability of [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) which is a superb plugin for the [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) text editor. For which I ended up writing [dbcli-telescope](https://github.com/mark-coyle/telescope-dbcli.nvim) which allows one to list & filter their dbcli related queries within neovim.

It was a good introduction to the world of neovim + lua and it's something I will likely try to get more invovled in.
